	Drug use in our society has increased drastically in the past decade.  Although some statistics show that alcohol and marijuana use among teenagers has dropped slightly in recent years, overall, drug use has exploded with the use/abuse of opioids and the introduction of new drugs like fentanyl and designer “drugs” like flavored vape. 
Unlike with my grandparents’ generation that really only used alcohol and tobacco, my generation is faced with a variety of new drugs such as Cocaine, Heroin and Fentanyl.  Not only are these drugs much more powerful and addictive, but they are extremely dangerous.  
One of the oldest and most widely used drugs is tobacco. There are many ways to use tobacco, such as smoking, snorting, chewing or vaporized. Short term health effects include increased blood pressure, breathing, and heart rate. Long term effects include lung cancer when smoked, oral cancer when chewed, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, heart disease, leukemia, cataracts, and pneumonia. Other health related issues include pregnancy miscarriage, low birth weight, stillbirth and learning and behavior problems.
Another drug that has been used almost as long as tobacco is alcohol.  Alcohol is a depressant and interferes with the way nerve cells normally send, receive, and process information. They do this by imitating the brain's chemical systems and circuits which affects many of the brain's functions including learning, judgment, decision making, stress, memory loss, and behavior.
Although cocaine is one of the oldest of the naturally occurring drugs, its popularity has increased significantly since the 1970’s. This powerful substance is typically sold in the form of a crystallized rock or powder which can be ingested through snorting, smoking or injecting. It is highly addictive and can cause headaches, seizures, lung damage and lead to an HIV infection.
Heroin is a highly addictive drug, even more than cocaine.  It is an opioid made from morphine, a natural substance extracted from the seed pod of various opium poppy plants. The drug’s common forms are typically a white or brownish powder or black sticky substance known as “black tar heroin”.  People can take this drug through injections, smoking, or snorting. The short term health effects include euphoria, dry mouth, itching, nausea, vomiting, analgesia, slowed breathing and heart rate. Long term effects may include collapsed veins, abscesses (swollen tissue with pus), an infection of the lining and valves in the heart, constipation and stomach cramps, liver or kidney disease and pneumonia. 
Fentanyl is an extremely powerful drug. It is similar to morphine, but it is much stronger. It is used to treat patients with severe pain or to manage pain after coming out of surgery. Many people who believe they are purchasing heroin are actually purchasing Fentanyl. This can often result in overdose and death. Fentanyl can be used by injection, snorting/sniffing, smoking, or it can be taken orally by pill or tablet.  This drug may cause changes in pupillary size, cold and clammy skin, cyanosis, coma, and respiratory failure leading to death.   
Most recently, e-cigarettes and vaping have been developed to reduce some of the risks of traditional cigarettes. However, doctors and scientists are starting to realize that vaping has its own hazards. To date, “there have been thirty six documented deaths and over fourteen hundred reported to hospitalizations'' as a result to vaping. Like many of the other drugs above, vaping is extremely addictive, mainly due to the designer flavors that have been developed that target young kids such as cool mint, crème brulee,and fruit medley. A lot of young teens start experiencing drugs in high school and end up getting addicted. In my high school, a lot of kids would go to the bathrooms and Juul with their friends. The amount of nicotine used in a pack of cigarettes is the same amount used in each Juul pod. 
People use drugs for a variety of reasons.  Some people use drugs to relieve stress. “A 2015 study conducted by the American Psychological Association (APA), measuring stress on a scale from 1-10 found that the average stress level for Americans stood at 5.1, a slight increase from the year before.” Others use drugs to deal with workplace or financial anxieties.  Still others just do it to hang with their friends and act cool. In addition to discovering drugs on their own or through peer pressure, children often get involved with drugs through a parent who is addicted to drugs. 
Although there is no one single age group that accounts for all drug use, there are certain demographics that use drugs more than others.  In particular, youths in the 18-25 year age group tend to use/abuse drugs more than any other age group. Other demographics that tend to use/abuse drugs are women, the affluent and Baby Boomers. While the reasons aren’t clear, what is clear is that women account for at least 50% of drug users, especially with prescription painkillers and alcohol while usage by the affluent and Baby Boomers may be attributed to financial means and fewer family and professional responsibilities, respectively. 



Drug use takes a terrible toll on individuals, families, and communities. Teachers can educate children on the importance of drug use and how it can destroy their life. Instead of turning to drugs try to find another alternative to relieve stress. There are many healthy alternatives to turn to such as sports, walking, doing yoga, reading, or even joining a gym. Another option to look into is rehab, it will help you steer clear from any type of drugs that you may have encountered in the future. Rehab is a friend, not an enemy. The quicker you quit the faster you’ll fight off your addiction. “People who smoke cigarettes are 15 to 30 times more likely to get lung cancer or die from lung cancer than people who do not smoke.” For a person who ends up quitting they have a lower risk of getting lung cancer. But compared to a non smoker, the risk of a former smoker has a higher risk and will likely end up relapsing in the future. 

Conclusion: Its a person's choice on how they choose to live their life. It's a risk they are willing to take. They know the outcome of smoking and how it can ruin a person's life. Don’t let any type of cigarettes tell you how to live your life. Make good choices, you only live once and try to steer clear from all of those drugs. They are really bad for your health. Don't sign yourself away to a piece of paper, go out their and live your life to the fullest.
